## IMGRP by Joe Joyave

deployed: http://development.im-grp.divshot.io/

This is a simple app using Angular.js.  It is a re-creation of a standard hosting site for images (like IMGUR, Amazon S3, etc.).

It contains a complete user login session, interacts with an API (via Parse), and stores and exports images.

Thanks: Materialize.css, Angular.js, jQuery, Underscore, Cookies.
